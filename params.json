  "body": "### Welcome to PremoFM\r\nPremoFM is a podcast app designed for those who love listening to podcasts.  You'll be able to subscribe to hundreds of thousands of audio podcasts and listen to millions of podcast episodes, including the insanely popular ones like Serial, This American Life, and Stuff You Should Know.\r\n\r\nPremoFM has been thoughtfully designed to follow Material Design while also adding unique flavor and interaction.  Podcast episode show notes are displayed right up front, so no more digging through an app to find out what an episode is really about.  The Now Playing experience is simple and unique, allowing quick and convenient control of your podcast playback.\r\n\r\nBest of all, PremoFM is completely free and open source with no obstructing ads or tricky trials.  PremoFM is listener-supported empowering podcast lovers to optionally contribute to support the continued development of PremoFM.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
